* List of things that need to be done for this library.

- Make a factory that handles the creation of all class instances.  It
  should handle to the bitset so that it only has to create 1 MAX_LEN
  bitset for each instance of the factory (or thread).
- Python error handling
- code all the messages that are around
- build testing infrastructure (nose?)
